    **Google Developer Groups on Campus Polytechnic University of the Philippines**, or **GDG PUP** for brevity, is a student-driven  organization supported by Google Developers, focused on creating a collaborative environment for  students to develop their technical skills and grow professionally. Our mission is to bridge the gap between theoretical  knowledge and real-world application, fostering a culture of peer-to-peer learning and innovation.  

    Founded in 2022, GDG PUP has quickly grown into a vibrant, university-wide community committed to empowering students in the fields of software development, engineering, and technology. By providing access to Googleâ€™s developer tools and resources, we support members in creating impactful solutions and projects that address real-world problems.

    At GDG PUP, we believe in the power of collaboration, creativity, and continuous learning. Our organization aims to:

    - Empower students through technology and programming education.  
    - Promote creativity, problem-solving, and innovation.  
    - Nurture the development of meaningful technological solutions for communities.  
    - Bridge the divide between theory and practice, turning learning into tangible experiences.  

    As we continue to grow, we remain focused on creating a space where students can network, learn, and contribute to the development of technology that can make a difference.   GDG PUP is a place where every student can thrive, and we believe that together, we can achieve great things by shaping the future of technology, one project at a time.
